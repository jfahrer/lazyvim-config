# Agent instructions

## Overview

This repository contains my LazyVIm configuration.

## Instructions:
* Eager load all plugins you add by default (`lazy = false`)
* C-s is my tmux leader key, so don't use that for anything
* Keep any plugin config to a minimum and don't add common defaults
* Do not commit any changes!
